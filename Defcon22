A Tour Through the Dark Side of the Internet

I was assigned, per my Intro to IT class , to watch the Defcon 22 conference with speakers Metacortex and Grifter. This presentation was very informative about hacking and accessing information anonymously on the web as well as in the deep web, with the use of a VNP or virtual private network. A VPN allows the user to browse the internet and view information that they would not want recorded or tracked.

Grifter and Metacortex start off the video showing the audience how to download the TOR browser(The Onion Router). Downloading the VPN, Tor, allows you to browse the internet anonymously. This is handled through a series of routers that anonymously forward traffic making your browsing private and secure.

The deep web gives a beginner coder, developer, or hacker quite a bit of insight that can become useful if he or she is looking into a career with cyber security, or just interested in what people are able to purchase and sell items and services anonymously online. The deep web can be used to buy simple legal items such as electronic devices or appliances, as well as the risqué items or services such as, stolen identifications, fake ID’s or passports, Drugs, Assassinations or body parts. I believe the benefits of being able to recognize and access sites or items only available via a VPN, are important for any person looking into a career in technology.

Something interesting I learned while watching this video was, if someone searches for, or downloads the TOR browser that person will be put on a list with the NSA, classified as an extremist.
